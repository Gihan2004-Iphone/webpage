                <p>A little over two weeks ago, a largely unknown China-based company named DeepSeek stunned the AI world with the release of an open source AI chatbot that had simulated reasoning capabilities that were largely on par with those from market leader OpenAI.

                <h2>2025 Genesis Electrified GV70 review: Wait for the next model year</h2>
				<img src="3.jpg" alt="genesis" height="400" width="600">
                <p>The Genesis Electrified GV70 continues to intrigue me. Together with the internal combustion engine version, it's the closest thing we'll get to a baby Bentley shooting brake, at least without being part of the Brunei royal family. It's a handsome five-door that looks almost station wagon-ish, without actually succumbing to the retail poison that body style has sadly become.
